        <h3>Pennon Shue</h3>
        <h2>
          I'm from Athens, Georgia and am a first year computer science major.
          I'm excited to make new memories at Georgia Tech! In high school, I
          ran fundraisers and food drives to help support iServe, a mobile food
          pantry. In addtion, I would volunteer on the weekends to help package
          and distribute necessities to those in need. At Georgia Tech, I have
          continued my passion for social good by volunteering at the Catholic
          Center with food distribution and joining Grand Challenges. I hope to serve different areas of my
          community through Bits of Good and create a positive impact.
